## ES5 Var

In the past ES5 specification, even if a variable was assigned inside of a code block, for example:

```liquid
{% raw %}
function hoist(x){
  var inside = x + 1;
}
{% endraw %}
```

That variable `inside` could still be *hoisted* and declared *outside* of the code block by the Javascript engine.

Indeed, even outside of the function!

And, therefore the variable would became exposed and at the same time yet available globally.

Some may think this is a good thing.

However, by extension the now *hoisted* variable also became subject to global corruption, as well.

Hence, the need to contain the scope of the variables declared in ES6.
